# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 1, 2016
- Started, working on what right now I plan on being an asteroids type game but I don't have 100% concrete idea yet.
- here's the commit https://github.com/fabean/buffhammer/commit/9ca7a7dc1d1ee347ffdb5a3120799784ebe38c52

### Day 2: September 2, 2016
- I got my gulp to actually be a server. I have a minor bug with the livereload, I know the issue just never addressed it becasue hitting refresh isn't that hard honestly.
- I couldn't get a solid 1 hour today to code, but I probably did a good 45 minutes throughout the day on this. I know that's basically failing the second day but tomorrow is the weekend and I'll have more time in the morning to get a couple hours done. It's midnight and I just got home from work, so get off my back... :)
